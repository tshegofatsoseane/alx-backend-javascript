### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. **Use Mocha to write a test suite:** Learn how to set up and structure test suites using Mocha.

2. **Utilize different assertion libraries (Node or Chai):** Understand how to choose and integrate assertion libraries like Node.js built-in assertions or Chai for more expressive testing.

3. **Present long test suites effectively:** Discover techniques for organizing and presenting extensive test suites to enhance readability and maintainability.

4. **Understand when and how to use spies:** Learn the concept of spies in testing and how to employ them effectively to observe function calls.

5. **Understand when and how to use stubs:** Explore the purpose of stubs in testing and learn how to use them to replace dependencies with controlled behavior.

6. **Learn about hooks and when to use them:** Understand the role of hooks in Mocha and when to use them for setup and teardown tasks in testing.

7. **Unit testing with Async functions:** Master the art of unit testing asynchronous functions to ensure proper handling of async behavior.

8. **Write integration tests with a small Node server:** Gain proficiency in writing integration tests for a small Node.js server to validate its behavior in a real-world environment.
